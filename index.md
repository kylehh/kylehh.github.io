I started writing blogs sicne BBS time, and unfortunately most early time writings are lost  
  
Then I wrote on MSN spaces, which closed later and all are transferred to wordpress.com (You can still find my blogs there~)    

I wrote on WeChat these days, most posting pictures, recording my daily life
 
Actually I didn't know what's the purpose of having another blog-ish thing, till one day I found that it can be used to record my learnings.

I read lilian blog so many times about stable diffsion, watched Hongyi Lee's lecture on youtube so many times about various topics of ML

But I fogot most of them after some time. So I decided to record them down, so easy for me to review and learn better
 
so here I am!
