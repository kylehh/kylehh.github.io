I started writing blogs since BBS time, but unfortunately most early time writings are lost  
  
Then I blogged on MSN spaces, which was closed down later and all blogs were transferred to wordpress.com (You can still find my blogs there~)    

I blogged on WeChat these days, mostly posting pictures, and recording my random thoughts

Actually I didn't know what's the purpose of having another blog-ish thing, till one day I found that it can be used to record my learnings.

I read Lilian's blog so many times about stable diffsion, watched Hongyi Lee's lecture on youtube so many times about various topics of ML

But I easily lost track of what I learnt after some time. So I decided to record them down, so easy for me to review and learn better
 
so here I am!
