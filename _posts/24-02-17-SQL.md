The first new thing I learnt in 2024 is SQL. I did a try back in 2022 job hunting, and was asked to write SQL quries in Databricks SA interview. I never write one single line of SQL before except for `SELECT * FROM table`. 
I studies all the SQL grammar for a week and did an interview again, and still failed. No suprise, knowing all the `JOIN` grammer doesn't really help unless you really wrtie SQL in practice.
