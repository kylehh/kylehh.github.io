This part will focus on how to host static webpage created by Hugo online, mainly leverage online cloud services like AWS S3.

## Step 1, Hugo build
Assume you already have a hugo website built in Part 1, something like the [tempalte](https://github.com/kylehh/workshop-template). Simly run `hugo` commend to build the web. It will generate building contens under the **public** folder. Of course, you can `rm -rf public` before building, since hugo will NOT remote the previous build. 

## Step 2, Upload to AWS
Install AWS CLI and have AWS credential setup, now simply upload the whole **public** folder into AWS S3.  
`aws s3 cp --recursive public s3://{bucketname}/`  
Here is the example of copying files into `kyle-hugo-sandbox` bucket, which is publickly accessible. (see next step)

## Step 3, AWS S3 Bucket configurations
There are 3 sub-steps to configure the S3 bucket with contents from hugo **public** folder to host the static website. 
### a, Enable the S3 **Static website hosting**.

### b, Disable **Block public access**. Please be very cautious about this step, b/c all contents could be public in this folder. So make sure you create a seperated bucket for hosting.

### c, Add bucket policy to **actually** allow the public access.

Now you should be able to access the website by clicking on the link under **Static website hosting** 
For example here, the link is [http://kyle-hugo-sandbox.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com](http://kyle-hugo-sandbox.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com)
