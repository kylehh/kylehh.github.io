Unit Test, is something I ignore for a long time. I know it existence but barely initiate one. If it's already in the system, I don't mind add one, like for Canopy.   
But recent requests I get, it always ask for unit tests, so here are some finding regarding pytest.

## 1. Test with Pytest
- Run code with pytest is straightforward, just `pytest code.py`
- User `assert` for test check, or define an assert_function 

## 2. Use decorators
- `@pytest.fixture` for predefine items can be used as function argument
- `@staticmethod` for test (or skill)
