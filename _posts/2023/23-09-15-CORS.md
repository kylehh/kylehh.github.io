It has been also two month sicne my last update. There is no execuse, but I do want to claim that I have been out of home fro Aug 1st to 22nd, and got totally swampped after that for some LLM related work before Ray Summit. 

Building a demo was one of them, and while working with AWS API Gateway, I met CORS authentication issue AGAIN

No surprise, CORS was one of the most common problem when you set up API gateway for endpoints. and this time I am recording what's the proper way to solve it

## 1, Enable CORS in API Gateway
This is the most obvious step to do, and just follow instructions on the console and use default options.An `OPTION` method will be added as `MOCK` integration type

## 2 Add modify the API resources
Now you need to modify `Integration reqeust` and `Integration response` for the `OPTION` method. I believe this is the key step to make CORS work. Some posts say you also need to modify `Header mappings`, and I also did, but Im not sure if it's necessary.

Even though Im not fully understand the 4 steps here, especially the differences between Method vs Integration, the `Mapping templates` need to be filled with proper json responses. 
- for `Integration reqeust` , add `{"statusCode" : 200}`
- for `Integration response` , add `{"statusCode" : 200, "message": "Go ahead without me"}`

## 3 Test CORS
[https://test-cors.org](https://test-cors.org/) is a simple website to test out your CORS setups. Using `POST` method and you are espected to see status 200.
