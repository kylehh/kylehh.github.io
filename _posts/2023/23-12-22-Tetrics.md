I was creating a Tetris game for the first time. Even though it was a popular programming task during college time, but I never actually tried to implement it. The algortithem seems straightforward and but it would take some time to think about the details.

The one I coded is a simpler version, which have same number of blocks, but no rotation needed. And when removing rows, the blocks will NOT fall to previous empty cells, which make the removing row super simple.
