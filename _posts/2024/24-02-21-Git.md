Migrate my notes on Git from Google Keep to here

# PR steps
1. create fork in the console
2. `git pull` and  `git checkout -b new_branch`
3. modify/add/commit/push origin  
`git push --set-upstream origin new_branch`
4. create pull request


# Sync your fork
1. `git remote add upstream git@xxxxx`

2. `git fetch upstream`
3. `git checkout main` and 
`git merge upstream/main`

# push fetched to fork
1. `git push` # to update 
2. more modify/push
3. `git brach -d new_branch`
4. `git push origin -d new_branch` ( delete the one in the console)

# Merge vs Rebase
More details at this [link](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing)

`git merge main`is a **non-destructive** operation. The existing branches are not changed in any way, and *feature* branch will have an extraneous **merge commit** every time you need to incorporate upstream changes.

**git rebase main** moves the entire *feature* branch to begin on the tip of the *main* branch, effectively incorporating all of the new commits in main. It **re-writes** the project history.

## The golden rule of rebasing
**Never** use it on public branch.
It will force *main* to get all commit from you, while others don't need.
