Last time I touched CUDA and GPU was in 2018, when I was preparing for job hunting at CGG. It's time to review some basics about GPU now

1. Ray Tracing
Ray Tracing models the behavior of light in the scene. The "ray" of light are followed, or "traced" to determine the color of all the objects in the scene.

2. Resolutions  
Displays consist of **pixels**.  The color of each pixel is determined by little programs, or **shaders**

A 4K display at 60Hz requires 5million (497,664,000 = 2160 x 3840 x 60) pixels

3. Virtual GPUs
  - Virutal PC
  - Virtual Applications: app streaming
  - RTX Virutal Workstations: performance graphics

4. CUDA Cores  
**CUDA cores** for parallel work  
**RT cores** for Ray Tracking acceleration  
**Tensor cores** for AI acceleration  

5. Networking
  - HPC: InfiniBand  
  - AI:  Mellanox GPUDirect RDMA(Remote Direct Memory Access)  
  - Storage: Ethernet Solutions/storage fabric
  - Cloud: BlueField DPU
  - Zero-Trust Security: Nvidia DOCA and BlueField DPU  
    - **Zero Trust** is a security framework requiring all users, whether in or outside the organization’s network, to be authenticated,and continuously validated for security configuration and posture before being granted or keeping access to applications and data. 
    - Versus traditional approach automatically trusted users and endpoints within the organization’s perimeter, putting the organization at risk from malicious internal actors
