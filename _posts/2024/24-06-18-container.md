Summary from this [post](https://vineetcic.medium.com/the-differences-between-docker-containerd-cri-o-and-runc-a93ae4c9fdac) 

## 1 OCR vs CRI 
- OCI (Open Container Initiative): a set of standards for containers, describing the image format, runtime, and distribution.
- CRI (Container Runtime Interface) in **Kubernetes**: An API that allows you to use different container runtimes in Kubernetes.

## 2 Lifecycle of docker
when you run a container with docker, you’re actually running it through the **Docker daemon**, which calls **containerd**, which then uses **runc**.

- Docker daemon: dockerd
- containerd: High-level container runtime
- runc: Low-level container runtime. (Includes libcontainer, a GO lib for creating containers)

## 3 K8s 
- K8s used to use Docker Engine to run containers
- K8s created CRI to run any containers
- Then it uses **dockershim** to run Docker container
- dockershim was removed completely, use containerd as successor to Docker Engine.

CRI is an interface used by Kubernetes to control the different runtimes that create and manage containers.

Red Hat’s OpenShift uses CRI-O

## Docker vs Podman
Podman is an open-source container orchestrator under the OCI standards developed by Red Hat.

It's the default container engine in RedHat 8 and CentOS 8.

- Docker uses a daemon to create images and run containers. 
- Podman has a daemon-less architecture
