The original motivation of this tech blog was to understand diffusion models.
It's such a beautify algorithm that I spent lots of time reading from 
1. Lilian's [blogs](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-07-11-diffusion-models)(Great summary of diffusion models. I feel this blog is Lilian's own study notes, in a high-bar quality.) 
2. Assembly AI's [blogs](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/diffusion-models-for-machine-learning-introduction/) (Shout out to Ryan O'Connor, who writes great blogs which has nothing to do Assemly AI's business :P)
3. 苏神's [blogs](https://spaces.ac.cn/archives/9119) (His blogs are totally in another level, from insightful math perspectives)

One year later, I decided to review them and record it down here.
I also found couple of good resources recently and mainly use them as the contents here.

While MLPs have fixed activation functions on nodes (“neurons”), KANs have learnable
activation functions on edges (“weights”). KANs have NO linear weights AT ALL – every
weight parameter is replaced by a univariate function parametrized as a spline.
