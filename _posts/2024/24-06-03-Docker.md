Almost every 6 months, I would look up the differences between Docker ENTERPOINT and CMD. Now it comes to my blog

## 0 Setting Env variable in Linux
Starting with a sublt differences between two ways of setting env var
```python
  # Only exist in this shell
  var = 1
  # Exist in other processes
  export var = 1
```
Another differences is that `env` or `printenv` can show var set by `export`, but NOT directly `=` assignment

## 1 Shell form vs Executable form
Shell form directly feed in commands
```shell
ENV name Darwin
CMD echo “Hello World”
ENTRYPOINT /bin/echo "Welcome, $name"
```
Executable mode directly runs the executable binaries, without going through shell validation and processing.
```shell
CMD ["yum", "-y", "install", "httpd"]
ENV name Darwin
# Welcome, $name
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/echo", "Welcome, $name"]
# Welcome, Darwin
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/bash", “-c” "echo Welcome, $name"]
```

## 2 ENTRYPOINT vs CMD
|-|ENTRYPOINT|CMD|
|--|--|--|
|order|First|Second|
|Default|can NOT be overwrite in docker run CLI|CAN be overwrite in docker run CLI|
|Ignore|will NOT be ignored| will be ignored with run parameters|
```shell
CMD ["Darwin"]
ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "Hello,"]
#docker run container
#output: Hello, Darwin
#
#docker run container Kevin
#output: Hello, Kevin # CMD ignored
```

## 3 ARG vs ENV
This picture explains all. 
- ARG only exists during the build time
- ENV exists in both build and run time,so you can see it in both image(with `docker inspect`) and container.

A side note, the `.env` file is used for `docker-composer.yaml` to get env var values.

Both ARG and ENV can be reset by CLI
