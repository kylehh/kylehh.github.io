## 0 The problem
We propose SSM to solve the slow inference issue for Transformers

## 1 State Space
State Space is vector representation of a state.

In NN, *state* is typically hidden state, in LLM, it's generating a new token. 

## 2 State Space Model (SSM)
These two equations are the core of the State Space Model.

and can be simplied as below with skip connection for matrix D

With discretization

## 3 RNN and CNN representation
It's very similar to RNN

and can use represented by CNN as well.
So 1D CNN for LLM with 1D kernel.

Now we have three representations

Combine the fast training for CNN and fast inference for RNN, we have **Linear State Space Layer**.

## 4 H3 and S4
In order to rememeber long context, HiPPO and H3 (Hungry Hungry HiPPO) was introduced here. The core idea is focus on near term memory but also have inifinte long term memory w large degration. 
![Alt text](/assets/images/2024/24-03-30-SSM-H3_files/h3.png)

Apply H3 to SSM, we have S4

Will discuss more details in the next blog.
