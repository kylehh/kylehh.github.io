Pytorch gets its own distributed implemetion, either through 
1. MPI backend, point to point, inspriation for `torch.distributed`
2. Meta's own [GLOO](https://github.com/facebookincubator/gloo, which is included in the pre-compiled PyTorch binaries 
3. Nvidia's [NCCL](https://github.com/nvidia/nccl), pronunced as "Nickel", which is **Optimized primitives for inter-GPU communication.**, which is for CUDA only.  
Check more details at this [link](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/dist_tuto.html)
## Distributed Computing
### Main program
Here we go, bring back the old memories of **rank** and **world_size**.
To simulate multiple machines, use different process to represent different machines (all running on a single machine).  
```python
import torch.distributed as dist
import torch.multiprocessing as mp
# The GLOO backend is used
def init_process(rank, size, fn, backend='gloo'):
    """ Initialize the distributed environment. """
    os.environ['MASTER_ADDR'] = '127.0.0.1'
    os.environ['MASTER_PORT'] = '29500'
    dist.init_process_group(backend, rank=rank, world_size=size)
    fn(rank, size)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    size = 2
    processes = []
    mp.set_start_method("spawn")
    for rank in range(size):
       # run is the Distributed function,to be implemented later.
        p = mp.Process(target=init_process, args=(rank, size, run))
        p.start()
        processes.append(p)

    for p in processes:
        p.join()
```

### Send and Receive 
A transfer of data from one process to another is called a **point-to-point** communication. These are achieved through the `send`/`isend` and `recv`/`irecv`.
```python
"""Blocking point-to-point communication."""

def run(rank, size):
    tensor = torch.zeros(1)
    if rank == 0:
        tensor += 1
        # Send the tensor to process 1
        dist.send(tensor=tensor, dst=1)
    else:
        # Receive tensor from process 0
        dist.recv(tensor=tensor, src=0)
    print('Rank ', rank, ' has data ', tensor[0])
```

Non-block send and receive can be synced by `wait()` call.
```python
"""Non-blocking point-to-point communication."""

def run(rank, size):
    tensor = torch.zeros(1)
    req = None
    if rank == 0:
        tensor += 1
        # Send the tensor to process 1
        req = dist.isend(tensor=tensor, dst=1)
        print('Rank 0 started sending')
    else:
        # Receive tensor from process 0
        req = dist.irecv(tensor=tensor, src=0)
        print('Rank 1 started receiving')
    # we should NOT modify the sent tensor nor access the received tensor before req.wait() has completed. It's all un undefined status till wait().
    req.wait()
    print('Rank ', rank, ' has data ', tensor[0])
```

### Collective Communications
More than `broadcast` is available here. 
![Alt text](/assets/images/2024/24-01-29-PyTorch-3_files/collective.png)
Here is an example of `all-reduce`
```python
""" All-Reduce example."""
def run(rank, size):
    """ Simple collective communication. """
    group = dist.new_group([0, 1])
    tensor = torch.ones(1)
    dist.all_reduce(tensor, op=dist.ReduceOp.SUM, group=group)
    print('Rank ', rank, ' has data ', tensor[0])
```

With data partition (see details in the original post), the training can be done with following code
```python
""" Distributed Synchronous SGD Example """
def run(rank, size):
    torch.manual_seed(1234)
    train_set, bsz = partition_dataset()
    model = Net()
    optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(),
                          lr=0.01, momentum=0.5)

    num_batches = ceil(len(train_set.dataset) / float(bsz))
    for epoch in range(10):
        epoch_loss = 0.0
        for data, target in train_set:
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            output = model(data)
            loss = F.nll_loss(output, target)
            epoch_loss += loss.item()
            loss.backward()
            ### need to average the grad.
            average_gradients(model)
            optimizer.step()
        print('Rank ', dist.get_rank(), ', epoch ',
              epoch, ': ', epoch_loss / num_batches)
```
in which, we will use `all_reduce` to average the gradients.
```python
""" Gradient averaging. """
def average_gradients(model):
    size = float(dist.get_world_size())
    for param in model.parameters():
        dist.all_reduce(param.grad.data, op=dist.ReduceOp.SUM)
        param.grad.data /= size
```
