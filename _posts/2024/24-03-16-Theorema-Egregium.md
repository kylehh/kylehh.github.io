Gauss's Theorema Egregium, which is Latin for "Remarkable Theorem", is a major result of differential geometry.
I found a good introduction [here](https://blog.sciencenet.cn/blog-677221-818928.html)
and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh_gjwSXTVg) by Yongle Li.

# 0 Intricint Geometry
The study is about intrinsic geometry. The length of an arch is one example, not changed by **curvature** or **torsion**.

# 1 Review of Curvatures
curvature $\rho$ is the reciprocal of the radius of curvature $K$

There are two principle curvatures, the min and max of all curvs. Defined by Euler in 1760.

# 2 Gaussian Curvature 
The mean curvature is the mean of principle curvatures, and the gaussian is the multiplication. It's intrinsic for a **surface**

The original defination is the ratio of the area of two surfaces.

Theorema Egregium gives birth to intrinsic geometry.
