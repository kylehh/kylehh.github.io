## 1 Motivation
HiPPO maps a input to a state, and now we need to project state to an output.

Now we get the full equations for S4, which is similar to SSM proposed by [R.E. Kalman](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~welch/kalman/media/pdf/Kalman1960.pdf) in 1960. 
$$x'=Ax+Bu \\y=Cx+Du$$ 

SSM + HiPPO + Structured Matrices = S4
## 2 General Properties of SSMs
1. Continuous representation
  - SSMs are paramiterized signal model
2. Recurrent representation
  - Output depeonds on the entire input but can be computed in constant time.

3. Convolutional representation
  - Output can be computed without computing state

  -EMA is a convo. with infinitely long kernels

## 3 S4 resolving limitations of SSM
- HiPPO state compresses the history of input.

So introducing it can boost the performance of naive SSM.

- SSM computation is SLOW
![Alt text](/assets/images/2024/24-05-10-S4_files/slow.png) 
and computer the kernal is as slow as the state. But we can use a structed kernel to make it fast.

Why the kernel works is not explained here

## 4 Addressing signal data with S4
For multi-dimen input, apply S4 per channel (like depthwise-separable CNN).
Traditional DL/ML can't not work well on bio data
![Alt text](/assets/images/2024/24-05-10-S4_files/vital.png)  
and break at different frequencies
![Alt text](/assets/images/2024/24-05-10-S4_files/freq.png)  
But S4 can be trained at different resolutoins w the same model due to it's continuous representation feature.

Even work on NLP tasks, it can get really close to transformers but much faster.
