I finially started the learning of [K8S](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics), and followed this offical doc to get my pods listed, deployment done, and service created. 

## 0 Cluster  
The nodes and control panel concepts are familiar, and k8s can **deploy** containerized apps into nodes, single or multiple. That's how it scales out applications.

## 1 Pods  
There are **kubelet** and docker runtime on each nodes, which is understanding. 
The **Pods** are the basic unit of K8S applications and it scales out by pod

## 2 Basic operations
```shell
#alias kc=kubectl
# both singular and plural works
kc get pod/deploy/service
kc describe pods/deployments/services

kc logs "$POD_NAME"
kc exec -it $POD_NAME -- bash
```

## 3 Proxy and Service 
All pods are internal traffic and not exposed by default. You can either use proxy and services to expose the pods

Assume the app is working on **port 8080**
```shell
# Running proxy 
# you will see "Starting to serve on 127.0.0.1:8001"
kc proxy
# curl 
curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods/$POD_NAME:8080/proxy/
```
A **Service** in Kubernetes is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them.

```shell
#To create a service 
kc expose deployment/kubernetes-bootcamp --type="NodePort" --port 8080
# Get the port from kc get services/$sevice_name
# 8080:31617/TCP
curl http://localhost:31617"
```

## 4 Labels
Use label to easy identify pods
```shell
kc label pods "$POD_NAME" version=v1
kc get pods -l version=v1
```

## 5 Scale
![Alt text](/assets/images/2024/24-08-19-k8s-101_files/scale.png)
```shell
# Create service with LoadBalancer type
kc expose deployment/kubernetes-bootcamp --type="LoadBalancer" --port 8080

kc scale deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp --replicas=4
# list pods and IP
kc get pod -o wide
```

## 6 Update app
Update the application by setting new images to the deployment
```shell
kc set image deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp kubernetes-bootcamp=docker.io/jocatalin/kubernetes-bootcamp:v2

kc rollout status deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp
kc rollout undo deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp
```
