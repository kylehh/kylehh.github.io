Basic ideas in Contrastive Learning and Kaiming's improvment in [MoCo](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.05722).

To do CL is supposed to be easiler than SL. Human is easy to distinguish objects rather than identify objects. The idea is similar to training embedding with triplets.

So with postive and negative samples, you are trained to distinguish them too.

## 2 Momentum Contrastive
Kaiming combined the end-to-end and memory bank and proposed momentum contrastive.

The loss is defined as InfoNCE

Try to meet both alignment and uniformaity goal.

Comparing to Memory Bank, it's similar to momentum in BP learning.
