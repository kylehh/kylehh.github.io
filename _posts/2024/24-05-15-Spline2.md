Second part of this [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvPPXbo87ds) talks about spines again. and I think I found some clue to 1/3 of vel in the previous spine 

## 1 Hermite Spline
If we define the velocity at each control point, then we get Hermite Spline.

and it can be convert to Bezier by adding control points with 1/3 of the velocity manipulations

## 2 Linear Spline
It's trivial but cheap

## 3 Cardinal Spline
On top of Hermite, if we define the velocity is in the direction of adjacent points, we get cardinal spline. The scale is used to control the length of vel. vector.

The **Catmull-Rom** is actually a special type of cardinal spline with scalar $s=0.5$

It's very smooth but still not $C^2$

## 4 B-Spline
In order to get $C^2$, we solve 16 equations (See details in Spline 1) then we get B-spline

and there are other types of B-spline is we change the interval length and give weights to different control points, it's call **NURBS** for short.
