This is one of most amazing [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvPPXbo87ds) for math concept introductionï¼Œtogether with a great [primer](https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/index.html)

## 0 Defination
Lerp means **L**inear int**erp**olation.
$$P(t) = (1-t)P_0 + tP_1$$
De Casteljau defination of Bezier curves is illustrated below with recursive lerps.

Separeting the $P$ values, gives you basis of Bezier functions

Two other definatinos are listed as polynomial coefficient and Matrix form

## 1. B-Spline
The shortage of Bezier curves are 
1. No local control (The basis covers the whole range)
2. Does NOT interpolate (except for start/end points)
3. Unstable and expensive to calculate
![Alt text](/assets/images/2024/24-05-14-Bezier_files/localcontrol.png) 
and the B-Spline solves all these issues
![Alt text](/assets/images/2024/24-05-14-Bezier_files/bspline.png)
We only consider equal knot interval B-splines

## 2. Parametric Continuity
$C^i$ continuous if 
$$A^{(i)}(t_{end})=B^{(i)}(t_{start}) \\ i={0,1,..n} 
$$ 

The continuity of B-spline is decided by the control points next to the knots. 
![Alt text](/assets/images/2024/24-05-14-Bezier_files/3types.png) 
**Broken** and **Aligned** knots give $C^0$ 
![Alt text](/assets/images/2024/24-05-14-Bezier_files/c0.png)
To get continuous velcocity, $P_4$ can NOT be random.
![Alt text](/assets/images/2024/24-05-14-Bezier_files/c1.png)
So, **mirrored** knots gives $C^1$ but NOT $C^2$
![Alt text](/assets/images/2024/24-05-14-Bezier_files/notc2.png)
To get $C^2$, $P_5$ is locked
![Alt text](/assets/images/2024/24-05-14-Bezier_files/c2.png)

$C^3$ gives you totally no control of the curve, and super sensative to the initial conditions. 
![Alt text](/assets/images/2024/24-05-14-Bezier_files/c3.png)
And it's same as extrapolating t to larger than 1 values. 
![Alt text](/assets/images/2024/24-05-14-Bezier_files/c3t.png) 
So it's not just $C^3$ but $C^\infin$

## 3 Geometry Continuity
For **Aligned** knots, if we ignore the magnitude of the velocity, and only looks at unit vector and it's norm, it's still continuous and called $G^1$.
![Alt text](/assets/images/2024/24-05-14-Bezier_files/g1.png)
How about $G^2$? This is the continuity of the reflections!!!
![Alt text](/assets/images/2024/24-05-14-Bezier_files/g1surface.png)
Even the circle surface is NOT $G^2$
![Alt text](/assets/images/2024/24-05-14-Bezier_files/g1circle.png)
Why? The norm direction of the curve have a non smooth change

## 4 Curvature
Curvature is defined as below
![Alt text](/assets/images/2024/24-05-14-Bezier_files/curvature.png)
and the relation between continuity and curvature is tricky
1. $C^0$ may have continuous curvature
2. $C^1$ does NOT guarantee the
 continuous curvature
![Alt text](/assets/images/2024/24-05-14-Bezier_files/relation.png)

So we can understand GC as below
1. $G^1$ is aligned curvature
2. $G^2$ is continuous curvature
3. $G^3$ is $C^1$ in curvature comb
![Alt text](/assets/images/2024/24-05-14-Bezier_files/g3.png)

or the official defination of GC is below.
![Alt text](/assets/images/2024/24-05-14-Bezier_files/gc0.png)
and it's related to Parametric Continuity as below
![Alt text](/assets/images/2024/24-05-14-Bezier_files/cg.png)

Now you can see the reflection is connnected on $G^2$ surfaces.
