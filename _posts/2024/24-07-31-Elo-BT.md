Worked on SW(Similarity Weighted) routing policy on [LLM Router](https://lmsys.org/blog/2024-07-01-routellm/), and learned Bradyley Terry and Elo score. Very interesting topics

## 1 Elo Score
Elo is how Chess players rank their levels. Similiarly it's used for Pingpong players. 
Yi Zhu also write a [blog](https://bryanyzhu.github.io/posts/2024-06-20-elo-part1/) about it and gives detailed explanations.

The basic idea is a score system that a player with 400 higher scores is 10x more likly to win. That's why the defaul scaler 400 is used 

## 2 Bradley Terry
Bradley Terry is a simple rule to rank teams and the interseting part is how it is related to logistical regressoin.
