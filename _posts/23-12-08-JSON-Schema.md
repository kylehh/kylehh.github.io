I was playing with function calling with AE, yes, now AE is the first host to enable function call/JSON model on open source models, `Mistral` and `Mixtral` series of models.

While looking at details for function defination, the OPENAI API document actually points me to JSON Schema [page](http://), and it's full schema defination using JSON. 

The defination is straightforward and easy to understand.
