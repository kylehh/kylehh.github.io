Happy $\pi$ Day!
It's time to review RL in 2025. This [zhihu](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/7461863937) gives me a much clear review of value based and policy based methods. I guess the yearly review on RL also improves my understanding of RL

## 1 $\pi$ vs $V_\pi$
RL can be summarized as two steps
1. Value evaluation: Given a policy $\pi$, how to correctly evaludate current value function $V_\pi$
2. Policy iteration: Given a current value function $V_\pi$, how to improve policy $\pi$

We perform these two steps in turn till converge and get the best policy $\pi^*$ and best value function $V_\pi^*$

Hence we can define **value-based** and **policy-based** method accordinng, or **actor-critic** for use it together.
