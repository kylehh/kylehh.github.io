Speculative Decoding w Eagles
## 0 Medusa review
[Zhihu](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/716344354) explains Medusa building the tree attention has $\Sigma_{i=1}^N\Pi_{j=1}^i{C_i}$ branches ($N$ head and $C_i$ tokens for each head). 
So pruning is critial for Medusa, like 4 heads [10, 10, 9, 4], the path will drop from 4610 to 64.
## 1 Eagle 1 
Instead of **token level** decoding, Medusa uses **feature level** decoding. Eagle use both token and feature features and also added **causal** 
This figure from Eagle [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15077) shows the differences.

Eagle builds a static draft tree and have multiple rounds of forward through the 1-layer transformer.

## 2 Eagle 2
[Eagle2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.16858) modifies the static tree to **dynamic**.

- Expand phase: Remove nodes with prob. less than a threshold
- Rerank phase: Reranking all the left nodes and keep top K.

## 3 HASS
HArmonized Speculative Sampling (HASS) is to improve the gap of features used in training and in inferences. [Zhihu](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/27272034867) explains it and introduce another work CORAL.

So the solution is **multi-step training**, which is sending features from draft model to training. 

## 4 Eagle 3
[Eagle3 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01840) is inspired from HASS and [zhihu](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/29007609465) summarized it as following improvments:  
1. Used 3 layers of features
2. Multi-step training similar to HASS
3. Remove Smooth L1 for feature, which was used to bring gaps of train/infer feature gasp. Not needed w Multi-step training.
