A k8s intro in Chinese from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL83f7Nzxr0). It explains k8s concepts in a much clear way and I finally feel that I understand the architecture of k8s

## 1 Services
Let's review ks8 components again

- Pod
Pod can have one or more containers. The best practice is one, and others are called side cars

- Service and NodePort
Pod's interal IP may change, so create a **service** can have fixed access to pod. and **nodeport** can be used for external access with a external facing port number.

-- Ingress
Ing is for external URL access

-- ConfigMap and Secrets
Both are used to record config data. Secrets used base64 encoding, so it's not really secret

-- Deployment
A group of pods can be deployed by a deployment. and **ReplicaSet** is between pod and deployment

Statefulset is a deployment for database

## 2 Master and Worker nodes
A worker has kubelet, kube-proxy(for networking), and a container runtime

Master is build around APIServer to interact with kubectrl command

- API Server: Gateway to the k8s
- Scheduler: monitor resource usage for all services, assign pod into node
- c-m: Control Mangaer, check resource status
- etcd: Key-value storeage, similar to redis. It's the brain of k8s and record all data for k8s
- c-c-m: Cloud-control-Manager, for connecting with EKS/AKS/GKS

## 3 K8S setup
- minukube: Creating a single node K8s
- multipass + k3s: A mini VM ware + mutile node k8s
- killacoda: online k8s sandbox

## 4 Examples
1. The best practice of creating a pod is by creating a deployment. A **replicaset** will be create and also a pod

2. Edit a deployment will automatically create cooresponding replicatset and pods

3. You can create a service or **expose** a deployment
![Alt text](/assets/images/2025/25-03-02-k8s_files/exp3.jpg)
4. The service config file use **selector** to match with pod **labels**
![Alt text](/assets/images/2025/25-03-02-k8s_files/exp4.jpg)
5. The nodeport can map internal **targetPort** into external facing **pord**

Here are list of other service type
