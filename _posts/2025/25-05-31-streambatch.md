One zhihu [blog](https://www.zhihu.com/question/585815572/answer/1909747138629436605) popped up on my frontpage and had some discussion about streaming batch process. So I followed couple of the passages and here are some high level summaries

## 1. Apach Spark
Detailed [here](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/606000899)

## 2. Apach Flink
Alibaba developed Blink based on Flink, and later open sourced it. It's all **steaming based** processing.  

## 3. Streaming Batch process
Ray data published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12407) discussing combining streaming and batch process. Stephanie Wang now is a AP at U. of Washinton.
