Created a [PR](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/pull/683) to add disagg skeleton example for Dynamo. This actually completes the Backend/Worker [guide](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/pull/608)

## 1 Processor  
Process is smiliar to the hello world multinode example with 2 changes
1. Adding `depends(Router)` 
2. Adding `kv` router mode, which will connect to a dummy kv routner for worker nodes selection and use `self.worker_client.direct(..., worker_id)` to specify a worker 

## 2 KV Router
This client depends on workers, so it has the same logic as Processor to get workers
1. The use `_cost_function` to decide worker selection and customization will be implemented in the cost function. In this dummy example, we used string matching score as the cost.  
```python
hit_rate = SequenceMatcher(
  isjunk=None,  ## junk char to ignore
  self.kv_cache[curr_id], ## target string
  request_prompt).ratio() ## compare string
```
2. Adding the KV metrics pulisaggregator examples  
```python
  self.runtime = dynamo_context["runtime"]
  kv_listener = self.runtime.namespace("dynamo-demo").component("DummyWorker")
  await kv_listener.create_service()
  self.metrics_aggregator = KvMetricsAggregator(kv_listener)
```
3. The use of this aggregator is integrated in vLLM backend. In this dummy example, we explicitly call this aagregator to get KV metrics.  
```python
metrics = await self.metrics_aggregator.get_metrics()
for endpoint in metrics.endpoints:
  logger.info(f"KV metrics:{endpoint.worker_id}, {endpoint.num_requests_waiting}")
```

## 3 Worker
KV publisher is initialized in worker and can publish KV metrics.
```python
self.component = dynamo_context["component"]
self.metrics_publisher = KvMetricsPublisher()  
# Register an endpoint for consumers of the KV Metrics
# (KvMetricsAggregator in kv_router) to listen/gather on.
self.metrics_publisher.create_endpoint(self.component)
self.metrics_publisher.publish(...)
```
